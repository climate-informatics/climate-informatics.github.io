In 2015, Climate Informatics community started to organize hands-on hackthons colocated with CI
conferences every year. These hackthon events bring together community members from different 
disciplines to collaboratively develop data science solutions for climate challenges.

## Future Events

In 2021, there will be a virtual Climate Informatics hackathon and tutorials on 7-10 September 2021.
The hackathon will be jointly organized with the [3rd NOAA Workshop on Leveraging Artificial Intelligence in Environmental Sciences](https://2021noaaaiworkshop.sched.com).
To receive the update about the hackathon and next CI conference (in 2022), you can sign up via this short 
[Google form](https://forms.gle/pz8WYEUohqfG3TEM9).

## Past Events & Materials

Past CI hackathons were archived on GitHub with related notebooks and materials. These materials are
very useful resources for anyone who want to learn more about the field of climate informatics.
