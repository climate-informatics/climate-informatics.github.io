title: "About Climate Informatics"
---

We are a group of people enthusiastic about the new field of climate informatics. By creating this web page we hope to bring people from different disciplines together, to form new collaborations and discuss new ideas. In short, to speed up the rate of discovery in climate science.

This test website was created by Yuhan (Douglas) Rao.

### What is Climate Informatics?

Climate informatics broadly refers to any research combining climate science with approaches from statistics, 
machine learning and data mining. Through the annual conference series and through this webpage we seek to 
bring together researchers from all of these areas. We hope to stimulate discussion of new ideas, foster 
new collaborations, grow the climate informatics community, and thus accelerate discovery across 
disciplinary boundaries.
