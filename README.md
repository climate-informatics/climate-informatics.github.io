# Climate Informatics community website guide

This repository host the website for the community of practice around climate informatics. 
The website is in its beta version and will have more updated features in the coming months.

By moving from the original drupal-based website to Jekyll-powered GitHub pages, this new 
community website allows contribution from all members to keep the community relevant and 
up to date. 

We hope members can contribute your recent publications, thoughtful writings, open data
sets, and relevant events to advance the field of climate informatics.
